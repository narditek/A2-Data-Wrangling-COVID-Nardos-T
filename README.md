# Analysis

What does each row in the data represent (hint: read the documentation!)?

The rows represent the dates, county, state, flips, cases, and deaths.

What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated the state with the lowest cases (and what does that tell you about testing your assumptions in a dataset)?

I learned that Northern Mariana Island has the lowest cases, leading me to assume that they could  have a smaller population. I think testing my assumption could be possible, if population were apart of the dataset and compared to see the association. 

Is the location with the highest number of cases the location with the most deaths? If not, why do you believe that may be the case?

Yes.

Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable lowest_in_each_state (i.e., wouldn't you expect the number to be ~50)?

Depending on the country, there could be a variation in population size which could affect the spread of the virus. For lower population countries the spread of the covid virus would be less.

What surprised you the most throughout your analysis?

What surprised me throughout the analysis was the amount of covid cases around the nation and the ability to tract all these records of cases.
